/*
 * MIDI support for pihpsdr
 *
 * (C) Christoph van Wullen, DL1YCF.
 *
 * Midi support works in three layers
 *
 * Layer-1: hardware specific
 * --------------------------
 *
 * Layer1 either implements a callback function (if the operating system
 * supports MIDI) or a separate thread polling MIDI data. Whenever a
 * MIDI command arrives, such as Note on/off or Midi-Controller value
 * changed, it calls Layer 2.
 *
 * Layer-2: MIDI device specific
 * ----------------------------- 
 *
 * Layer2 translates MIDI commands into pihpsdr actions. This is done with
 * a table-driven algorithm, such that the same translator can be used for
 * any MIDI device provided the tables have been set up correctly.
 * It seems overly complicated to create a user interface for setting up
 * these tables, instead a standard text file describing the MIDI device
 * is read and the tables are set up.
 * Layer-2 has SDR applications in mind, but is not necessarily specific
 * to pihpsr. It calls the Layer-3 function.
 *
 * Layer-3: pihpsdr specific
 * -------------------------
 *
 * Layer 3, finally, implements all the "actions" we can make, such as TUNE
 * or VFO. This Layer calls pihpsdr functions.
 *
 * One word to MIDI channels. Usually, a MIDI device can be configured to use
 * a specific channel, such that different keyboards use different channels.
 * The Layer-2 tables can either specify that the MIDI command has to come from
 * a specific channel, or can specify that the action will be taken not matter which
 * channel the MIDI message comes from. The latter case should be the default, but
 * if we want to connect more than one MIDI device, we need to speficy the channel.
 *
 * In principle this supports more than one MIDI device, but in this case they
 * must generate MIDI events on different channels

// Data structure for Layer-2

//
// There is linked list of all specified MIDI events for a given "Note" value,
// which contains the defined actions for all MIDI_NOTE and MIDI_CTRL events
// with that given note and for all channels
// Note on wheel delay:
// If using a wheel for cycling through a menu, it is difficult to "hit" the correct
// menu item if wheel events are generated at a very high rate. Therefore we can define
// a delay: once a wheel event is reported upstream, any such events are suppressed during
// the delay.
// 
// Note that with a MIDI KEY, you can choose that an action is
// generated only for a NOTE_ON event or both for NOTE_ON and
// NOTE_OFF. In the first case, if the key is associated to MOX,
// then MOX is toggled each time the key is pressed. This behaves
// very much like point-and-clicking the MOX buttion in the GUI.
//
// If an action is generated both on NOTE_ON and NOTE_OFF,
// then MOX is engaged when pressing the key and disengaged
// when releasing it. For MOX this makes little send but you
// might want to configure the TUNE button this way.
// The latter behaviour is triggered when the line assigning the key
// or "NOTE OFF". The table speficying the behaviour of layer-2 thus
// contains the key word "ONOFF". This is stored in the field "onoff"
// in struct desc.
